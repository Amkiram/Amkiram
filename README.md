- 👋 Hi, I’m @Amkiram
- 👀 I’m interested in all code, ever. It makes me so happy. Creating something 'out of nothing' is the best feeling in the world, especially when you have been stuck for hours and finally solve your problem!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic HTML and CSS on my way to becoming a front-end developer (and then full-stack, but got to start somewhere!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping you find the error in your code. I love spotting a bug or finding a fix.
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on Twitter @amkiram , or use the contact page on www.amkimoors.com . Or email amki@amkimoors.com , even.
